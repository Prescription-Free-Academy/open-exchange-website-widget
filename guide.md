## Steps taken to complete this project
***

### Step 1
Figure out a design for the widget and implement a mockup with *HTML* and *CSS*. Use a `table` for the ticker ID's and value.

**Extra considerations:**/
transform the widget into a re-usable component allowing easy implementation and editing for users dropping it into their sites. You could introduce variables, have your styling only apply within the component to avoid conflicts etc.

### Step 2
Implement a method to display the ticker data. You could use the `template` tag to add a table row, manipulating the `textContent` or `innerText`. Shorten the price to a nice readable format also and add a currency symbol.

### Step 3
Implement a method to change the currency symbols. You could have a row of symbols for users to choose between on the widget ui.

### Step 4
Implement a feature to change the display of the table between portrait and landscape. Try adding a new `template` or changing the visuals using *CSS*.
