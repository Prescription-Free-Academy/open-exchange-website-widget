If you prefer more structure, the tasks below can provide that.

Ongoing support and guided learning is available from Nigel via [Prescription Free Academy](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

## Essentials
The following tasks are considered essential. They set up the basic functionality of the widget.

### Step 1: Widget Design
Figure out a design for the widget and implement a mockup with *HTML* and *CSS*. Use a `table` for the ticker ID's and values.

### Step 2: Data Display Implementation
Implement a method to display the ticker data. You could use the `template` tag to add a table row, manipulating the `textContent` or `innerText`. Shorten the price to a nice readable format also and add a currency symbol.

### Step 3: Currency Switch
Implement a method to change the currency symbols. You could have a row of symbols for users to choose between on the widget ui.

### Step 4: Table Display Toggle
Implement a feature to change the display of the table between portrait and landscape. Try adding a new `template` or changing the visuals using *CSS*.

## Further Work
The following tasks are suggested improvements and features. Feel free to come up with your own! Let us know what you come up with so it can be shared with others here.

### Component Reusability
transform the widget into a reusable component allowing easy implementation and editing for users dropping it into their sites. You could introduce variables, have your styling only apply within the component to avoid conflicts etc.
