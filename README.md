# Open Exchange Website Widget

This is an implementation of a client for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It constitutes a widget for displaying ticket prices on a website.

## What’s all this about?

It’s all part of a [collaborative project](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) for learning web development and software engineering. All backed by a highly experienced teacher who has stepped away after twenty years in software development to concentrate on teaching.

[Mentoring is available](https://prescriptionfree.academy/) as needed, seven days a week.
